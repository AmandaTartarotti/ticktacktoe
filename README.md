## LDTS_1203 - Tick Tock Toe
In this 2 player game we have a tic-tac-toe grid where each square has inside it a traditional game of tic-tac-toe.

Players choose smaller tic-tac-toe boards to play, with each move determining the next board the opponent would play. Winning a small board claims the corresponding square in the larger grid; the game ends when one player wins the larger grid or in a tie.

After the game ends the players scores are updated accordingly to the result, it is shown how much time the game lasted and the time of the shortest game,
players also have the choice to keep playing in which case the game restarts. 


This project was developed by Amanda Tartarotti (202211647@up.pt) Gonçalo Sousa (202207320@up.pt) and Pedro Oliveira (up202206498@up.pt) for LDTS 2023⁄24.
