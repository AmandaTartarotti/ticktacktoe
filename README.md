# Jogo da Velha 2.0

The game is basically composed of a Main Tic Tac Toe Game that contains a Mini Tic Tac Toe Game within each space of the Main Tic Tac Toe Game. The game begins with the order of play of players "X" and "O" being defined by a coin toss, randomly. Next, the player who starts the game chooses where he wants to start playing, but the place where the player places his piece will define which Mini Tic Tac Toe Game the opponent will play in his turn.
When someone wins one of the games, the entire mini tic-tac-toe becomes a point for that player and whoever makes a row with three mini tic-tac-toe games in the Main Tic-Tac-Toe Game wins.
During the game two things can happen:
- A player is forced to play in a Mini Tic Tac Toe Game that has already ended, in which case the player can choose which available Mini Tic Tac Toe Game he wants to play.
- A Mini Tic Tac Toe will tie, in this case, this mini-game will work as a joker that works with both players to form the Main Tic Tac Toe row.
