                      The Game Goal:

  The game consists of a Main Tic Tac Toe board, where
  each space contains a Mini Tic Tac Toe game. Players
  "X" and "O" determine their order through a coin toss.

  The starting player selects a space to play, determining
  which Mini Tic Tac Toe game the opponent should play.
  Winning a Mini Tic Tac Toe awards a point, and whoever
  forms a line of three Mini Tic Tac Toe wins the overall
  game. During the game, two scenarios can occur:

  -> A player can be forced to play a full Mini Tic Tac Toe,
  being able to choose any available space for their move.

  -> A Mini Tic Tac Toe may end in a tie, serving as a wild
  card for both players in forming the Main Tic Tac Toe row.
